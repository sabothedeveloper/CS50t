- How are MIDI files different from MP3 files for the same song?

  > MIDI files store musical notes and commands, while MP3 files store compressed audio data.

- What is a keyframe?

  > Keyframe defines a start and end point for animations.

- When might you want to use a GIF instead of a JPEG?

  > When you want to embed an animation or short video GIF can do this, but JPEG is static. Also GIF is lower quality (8-bit color ratio)

- When might you want to use a JPEG instead of a GIF?

  > When you want to have high quality photos (24-bit color ratio)

#### Consider the GIFs below.

French:  
![French](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70684698/173798358-3d376a90-69bf-48ab-a446-24ac6ce0755c.png)

German:

- Let's assume that these images are the same resolution -- 300 pixels by 200 pixels, and both are static (non-video/non-looping) GIFs. Nevertheless, it turns out that the German GIF is smaller (i.e., fewer bytes) than the French GIF. Hypothesize why that might be.
  <p style="font-size: small">Be sure to re-read this stipulation carefully. When you download these images, you may find that the German GIF is bigger, for example (there are different GIF-encoding techniques which can cause this). Nevertheless, we are stipulating that they are both 300x200, and that the German one is smaller, and that should be your assumption in your answer.</p>

  > The German GIF might be smaller due to differences in color complexity, image content, or encoding techniques used, resulting in varying compression efficiencies even at the same resolution.

- In the context of RGB color, what is ff00ff, most likely?

  > Magenta

#### Keep in mind that "1-bit color" connotes two colors, black and white.

- If an image supports "8-bit color," (roughly) how many colors does it support?

  > 256

- If an image supports "24-bit color," (roughly) how many colors does it support?

  > 16777216

#### Consider the video below.

- Why does making an image bigger not make it clearer?
  > The video by default has low resolutionn

#### Consider the childhood "flip book" below, each of whose pages has a slightly different drawing of a shape.

Flip book:

- In what way is a childhood "flip book" like a digital video?
  > The flipbook creates an effect when flipped quickly static drawings give off the illusion that it is animated just like an animation switching frames.
