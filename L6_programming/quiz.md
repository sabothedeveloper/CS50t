#### Scratch

Head to scratch.mit.edu and sign up for an account on MIT’s website by clicking "Join Scratch" atop the page. Any username (that’s available) is fine, but take care to remember it and your choice of password.

Then head to https://scratch.mit.edu/ideas and take note of the resources available to you before you dive into Scratch itself. In particular, you might want to try out the Getting Started tutorial for Scratch at https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted.

Now it’s time to choose your own adventure! Your mission is, quite simply, to have fun with Scratch and implement a project of your choice (be it an animation, a game, interactive art, or anything else), subject only to the following requirements:

- Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Your project must use at least one sound.
- Your project must use standard Scratch blocks only to satisfy the above requirements (no add-ons).
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

Once finished with your project, click See project page in Scratch’s top-right corner. Ensure your project has a title (in Scratch’s top-left corner), some instructions (in Scratch’s top-right corner), and some notes and/or credits (in Scratch’s bottom-right corner). Then click Share in Scratch’s top-right corner so that others can see your project. Finally, take note of the URL in your browser’s address bar. That’s your project’s URL on MIT’s website. Your response should look exactly like this: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/XXXXXXXXX (where XXXXXXXXX is a nine-digit number).

- Write a program in pseudocode (i.e., step-by-step instructions in English) with which a human (or, if you prefer, a robot) could make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (correctly).
    <p style="font-size:small">You may assume that the human (or robot) has access to a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, a jar of jelly, a plate, and a knife, but may assume nothing beyond that.</p>

  > 1. 1. Take two slices of bread from the loaf.
  > 2. Take the peanut butter jar.
  > 3. Open the peanut butter jar.
  > 4. Take a knife.
  > 5. Using the knife, scoop some peanut butter from the jar.
  > 6. Spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread.
  > 7. Take the jelly jar.
  > 8. Open the jelly jar.
  > 9. Using the knife, scoop some jelly from the jar.
  > 10. Spread the jelly on the other slice of bread.
  > 11. Place the two slices of bread together, with the peanut butter and jelly sides facing inward.
  > 12. Press the slices together gently to form the sandwich.
  > 13. Put the sandwich on a plate.
  > 14. Optionally, you can cut the sandwich diagonally or into halves for easier handling.
  > 15. The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is ready to be served and enjoyed!

- What is a Boolean expression? Provide an example (in English or pseudocode) of one.

  > Booleans expressions return a true or false value based on a condition.
  > 'John is a good student.'

- What does it mean to compile a program?

  > It means translating code into machine-readable instructions (machien code).

- Why do we sometimes break our code out into separate functions, rather than one large program?

  > Breaking code into functions improves readability, reusability, and maintainability of the program's logic.

- What does it mean for a program to be multithreaded?

  > A multithreaded program can execute multiple tasks concurrently.
