- If, like me, you sometimes count using your fingers, odds are you can count up to 5 things on one hand (using 5 fingers). But that's if you're using "unary" notation, whereby you only have a single digit (pun intended) at your disposal, a finger, which you can think of as a 1. Binary, by contrast, allows you to use two digits, 0 and 1. How high could you count on one hand (with 5 fingers) using binary? Assume that a raised finger represents a 1 and a lowered finger represents a 0.

  > 31

- Recall that we looked at ASCII in lecture, which uses just 7 or 8 bits to represent letters of the alphabet. Read up on "Unicode," as via Google, and explain in your own words how Unicode is able to represent many more symbols than can ASCII, which is particularly helpful for written languages with many more characters than English.

  > ASCII represents English characters using the range from 0 to 127. On the other hand, Unicode utilizes a unique meth
  > define each character, allowing it to represent a much broader range of characters, including symbols, emojis, and more.

  There's a way to make this meaningful; find it!

  > The answer is 42.

- Describe at least one key difference, other than size/storage capacity, between RAM and hard disk.

  > RAM is volatile, it stores data when you power the computer on, on the other hand Hard disks are non-volatile and they store
  > data whenever you power on or off.

- Some computers, particularly PCs, come with stickers that say "Intel Inside." What is it that's inside of most computers that's made by Intel? In your own words, what does that hardware do?

  > It refers to the Central Processing Unit, in other words the CPU. There are 4 main generations, i3, i5, i7 and i9. These newer CPU's are cored meaning the computer can compute different tasks at the same time.

- Roughly how much RAM might a new laptop come with these days?

  > 8GB on average.

- Roughly how much disk space might a new laptop come with these days?

  > 256 GB.

- Name a single device that can be connected to a laptop or desktop via "USB".

  > Keyboard.

- What purpose does a device driver serve?

  > Device driver enables OS to communicate with hardware efficiently.

- Even though both are wireless, how does Wi-Fi differ from Bluetooth? You're welcome to Google as needed, but take care to distinguish the two in your own words.

  > Wi-Fi: Faster, longer-range, for internet connectivity. Bluetooth: Short-range, low-power, for peripherals.
